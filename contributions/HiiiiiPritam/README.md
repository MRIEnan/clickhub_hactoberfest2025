# Buttons by @HiiiiiPritam

A collection of polished, creative, and accessible buttons:

- Aurora Prism Button: Aurora gradient, glass sheen, playful depth.
- Liquid Ripple Button: Click ripples emanate from the click point.
- Magnetic Blob Button: Gooey radial highlight follows your cursor.
- Neon Trace Button: Cyber neon border that orbits on hover.

Each button:
- Uses semantic `<button>` and keyboard interactions (Enter/Space).
- Avoids external dependencies and large assets.
- Keeps styles scoped (prefixed with `hip-`).

Happy Hacktoberfest!
